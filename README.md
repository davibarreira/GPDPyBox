# GPDPyBox
My personal General Purpose Data Analysis Python Tool Box.

## 1. Description:
This repository main objective is to store in an inteligible manner some of my personal scripts for doing data analysis in python.
Most of what I coded has being spread out in many python notebooks and personal scripts, and when I need to remember how to do something I have to hunt it in my computer files. Therefore, this repo was created as a central hub for all this code... Perhaps all this maybe turned into a python library later.
